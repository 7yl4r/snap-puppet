Installs ESA BEAM SNAP & plugins with puppet.
`.nbm`, `.jar`, and large install4j `.sh` files not included in this repo, but happily shared on request.

TODO:
* set "Tools > Plugins > Settings > Plugin Install Location" to "Force install into shared directories" from CLI
    - This makes it so users cannot update or install plugins to their home directories. The root user should do this so updates/plugins install globally.

SNAP versions:
* 5.0.0
* 6.0

plugins:
* [s3tbx-c2rcc](https://github.com/bcdev/s3tbx-c2rcc)
